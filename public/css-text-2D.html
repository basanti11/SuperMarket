        The Supreme Court has sought the Government’s response to appeals to allow same-sex marriage under a special
        ,in another bid to provide legal sanction to widening social customs. A Bench of CJI D.Y. Chandrachud and
        Justice Hima Kohli agreed to hear two partners who said the non-recognition of same-sex marriage amounted to
        discrimination that struck at the rights of LGBTQIA+ couples. The petitioners cited the Special Marriage Act,
        1954, which provides a civil marriage for couples who cannot marry under their personal law. Listing the case
        for hearing, the Court also transferred cases pending before several High Courts to itself. It is a first step
        towards same-sex marriage, which has been legalised in 30-odd countries, including the U.S. where this July
        the House of Representatives approved legislation to protect such marriages. This legislative action came amidst 
        concern that an aggressive Supreme Court could revisit settled laws after it overturned Roe vs Wade on abortion
        rights. After the K.S. Puttaswamy verdict (2017) which upheld the right to privacy and Navtej Singh Johar 
        (2018) that decriminalised homosexuality, there was hope that same-sex marriages would follow, but that has
        not been the case. At depositions in courts and outside, the Centre has opposed same-sex marriage, and said
        judicial interference will cause “complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws”.
