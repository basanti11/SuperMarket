            Many technological advancements have led to societal changes. The earliest known technology is the
            stone tool, used in the prehistoric era,[4] followed by fire use, which contributed to the growth 
            of the human brain and the development of language in the Ice Age.[5] The invention of the wheel in
            the Bronze Age enabled wider travel and the creation of more complex machines.[6] Recent technological
            developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication
            barriers and ushered in the knowledge economy.
            While technology contributes to economic development and human prosperity, it can also have negative
            impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or cause social harms like technological unemployment
            caused by automation.[7] As a result, philosophical and political debates have arisen over the role and
             use of technology, the ethics of technology, and the mitigation of technology's potential downsides.
             Historical and contemporary movements like neo-Luddism and anarcho-primitivism criticize technology's
             pervasiveness,[9] while adherents to transhumanism and techno-progressivism actively support technological
             change, viewing it as emancipatory.[10] Many negative impacts of technology can be mitigated through technological
             innovations like renewable energy in transportation and industry,[11] genetically modified crops to address
             soil depletion,[12] and space exploration to mitigate global catastrophic risks.[13]
